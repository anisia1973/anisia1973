	<h2>Re-Establish Clean Air in Your Post-Flood Homes </h2>
		<p>Whether you are experiencing a roof leak, broken refrigerator or<br>
		toilet supply line, or moldy smells, have your home inspected by the<br>
		remodeling experts at Classic Shades Painting Water Damage & Restoration, LLC.<br>
		Our qualified contractors in Phoenix, Arizona, offer detailed building inspections<br>
		and moisture readings to assess the extent of your water damage. When leaky roofs<br>
		and overflowing wastewater lines occur, call on us to identify the underlying<br>
		issues. We offer immediate solutions to restore your home and prevent the growth<br>
		and spread of harmful mold.</P>
	<h3>Damage Categories & Magnitudes</h3>
		<p>Should your home become unsafe for habitation due to rising water and mold<br>
		presence, our team will come and inspect your property to determine the best course<br>
		of recovery. Using advanced tools and measuring methods, we first classify the damage<br>
		and threat level before taking action. Your property is classified into one of three<br>
		categories, depending on the type of water leak, how long it has been there, and what<br>
		areas or rooms are flooded. These categories include:</p>
		<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Catagory Stages</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Category 1:</td>
		<td>An overflow of faucet water on a first floor only.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Catagory 2:</td>
		<td>A two-story home overflows from an upper level or water has become stagnate.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Category 3:</td>
		<td>When wastewater backflows and comes into contact with any surface, this is a<br>
			biohazard. In these cases, containment is top priority and any wood or tile <br>
			that has been damaged must be removed.</td	
	</tr>
