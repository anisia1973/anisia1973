	<h2>Full-Service Residential Roof Repair</h2>
		<p>From pitched tile, shingle, or flat foam roofs, we have you covered.</p>			
	<h3>Tile Roofing</h3>	
		<p>Tile roofing is beautiful, but not waterproof. Tile roofing is a watershed<br>
		   and a decorative roof covering. The actual waterproofing is provided by the<br>
		   underlayment, or felt paper installed underneath the tile. Some felt is organic,<br>
		   but all deteriorate over time, especially in the "Arizona sun". This usually<br>
		   takes 12 to 20 years, depending on several factors, and then the felt must be<br>
		   removed and replaced (R&R).<br>

	<h3>Shingle Roofing</h3>
		<p>Shingles come in a wide-variety of styles, quality, and colors. Shingle roofs<br>
		   can be overlaid with a new roof, if the initial roof is a single layer<br>
		   (3-tab shingle) and in good condition. The life expectancy of composition<br>
		   shingles depends on the rating and ranges from 20 to 50 years. Most manufacturers<br>
		   will cover a composition roof under warranty, but only if it has been installed<br>
		   by a certified roofer.</p>
	<h3>Flat-Foam Roofing</h3>
		<p>Sprayed Polyurethane Foam is applied as a liquid using plural-component spray<br>
		   equipment to fill cracks and crevices. Because Polyurethane is lightweight, it<br>
		   adds little additional weight to the structure and is often used in remedial<br>
		   application (which means it can overlay an existing roofing system). Polyurethane <br>
		   Foam has a history of more than 35 years as a maintainable roofing medium and adds<br>
		   excellent insulation value to the structure.</p>
